# 9-11 Game [WIP] (May be offensive)
## Lore
On September 11th, 2001, two planes crashed against the Twin Towers in New York, bringing them down, in a terrorist attack by Al-Qaeda.

There were also another two planes, but nobody gives a fuck about those.

When the US president, George Bush, was told about the attack, his response was: "Really? Aw, dang it. Well, I guess we'll just fucking build another pair of Twin Towers"

There days later, the new towers, the Twin Towers 2, officially opened to the public.

When the Al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, was told about the new towers, his response was: "Really? Aw, dang it. Well, I guess we'll just fucking do it again"

Three days later, which is today, the attack will take place. As Al-Qaeda's newest intern, you have been tasked with carrying it out.

Unfortunately, it seems like this time there will only be a single plane involved because for some reason, after 9/11, Al-Qaeda suffered a shortage of pilots.

Your objective is clear: bring down both towers.

Rumor has it, though, that the new towers have anti-plane security measures to prevent someone like you doing something like this... again.

But that's bullshit, right? What could those measures even be...?
